This paper detailed methods of using a peer-to-peer network to generate what was described as 'a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust'. In January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence with the release of the first open source bitcoin client and the issuance of the first bitcoins with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the first block of bitcoins ever known as the genesis block, which had a reward of 50 bitcoins. The value of the first bitcoin transactions were negotiated by individuals on the bitcointalk forums with one notable transaction of 10,000 BTC used to indirectly purchase two pizzas delivered by Papa John's.")

Transactions werent properly verified before they were included in the transaction log or blockchain, which let users bypass bitcoins economic restrictions and create an indefinite number of bitcoins. On 15th August, the vulnerability was exploited; over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a transaction, and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted and erased from the transaction log after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in bitcoins history")
